**Fisher's Irish Data Set Description**



## Data Files

Note that the Fisher's Iris data file is located [here](https://github.com/davidobrien1/project-iris-data/tree/master/Data)

**Creating the Readme file**

As the first part of this project involved creating the project plan within the Readme file, I found myself researching various formatting syntax for Markdown files.  Much of the information found online seems to be repetitive and I found that the references in [2](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and [3](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) below cover much of the information I required for this project.
